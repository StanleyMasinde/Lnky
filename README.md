Remove tracking IDs from links with ease. Websites add query parameters to links to track the link users. 
These trackers could make these websites build a profile on you and those who you know. 
creepy right? 

## How to use Android
This tool works best when installed as a PWA. 
- Install it to your homescreen
- when sharing a link from other apps, select this app as the share target
- It will automatically remove the tracking ids and give you an option to either copy or share link.

## How to use iOS
iOS does not play nice with PWAs, you'll have to open the app from your homescreen;
- Paste the link
- Click clean
- Copy or share
